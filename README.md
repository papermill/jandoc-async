pandoc-api
============

*async fork of [jandoc](http://npmjs.org/package/jandoc)*

**DO NOT USE THIS!** It is just for experimentation and internal use in the `papermill` project and I hope to merge it back some day.

I really like `jandoc` api, but it was synchronous only.
While my first try at adding an async API while not breaking the original API was mildly successful, 
I want to do more heavy restructuring, so I am not keeping the sync API for now.
