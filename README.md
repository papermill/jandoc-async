pandoc-api
============

*async fork of [jandoc](http://npmjs.org/package/jandoc)*

**DO NOT USE THIS!** It is just for experimentation and internal use in the `papermill` project and I hope to merge it back some day.

I really like the`jandoc` api, but it was synchronous only.

While my first try at just adding an async API was mildly successful, 
I want to do more heavy restructuring, so I am **not keeping the sync API** for now.
